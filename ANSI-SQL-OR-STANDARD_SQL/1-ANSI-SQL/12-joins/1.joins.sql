/*

The JOIN clause is used to join/connect records from 2 or more tables based on a related column between these tables.
The table you write **before** the `JOIN` keyword is the **left table**, and the one you write **after** it, is the **right table**.

Types of Joins in SQL:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT (OUTER ) JOIN
- RIGHT (OUTER ) JOIN
- FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- SELF JOIN
- CROSS JOIN (**Cartesian Product)**
